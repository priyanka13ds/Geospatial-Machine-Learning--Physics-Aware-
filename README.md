# Physics-Aware Geospatial Machine Learning

This project explores how **physics-inspired constraints** such as spatial continuity and sensor realism can improve machine learning performance on **satellite land-cover classification** tasks.

## Problem Statement
Purely data-driven ML models often produce noisy or physically implausible predictions on satellite imagery. This project investigates how incorporating **domain knowledge from physics and geospatial sensing** can improve prediction reliability.

## Approach
- Baseline machine learning model for land-cover classification
- Physics-aware enhancements using spatial consistency assumptions
- Comparative evaluation between baseline and physics-aware outputs

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Status
🚧 Work in progress — currently focusing on baseline model implementation and physics-aware post-processing.

## Future Work
- Advanced spatial constraints
- Model generalization analysis
- Extended evaluation on additional datasets
